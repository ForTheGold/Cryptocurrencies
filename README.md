# Cryptocurrencies

Using unsupervised learning to discover patterns in cryptocurrencies

## Background

A friend of mine has always been a big dreamer who wants to change the world.  She has been preparing to pitch the investment opportunity of cryptocurrencies to her firm, and needs a data analyst in order to find trends and visualize the data.  We both feel that cryptocurrencies will change the world and so I have been excited to have the chance to help out.

Although the popularity of BitCoin has caused a price jump that makes it unaffordable for many investors, there are a great deal of other coins that are more affordable for investors.  We have a dataset of cryptocurrencies that we used to identify trends and find the next big investment opportunity.  We used unsupervised machine learning to do the job.

## Method

We used a K-means algorithm to create buckets which the algorithm put the cryptocurrencies into.  The buckets are from 0-3 as shown below.



Here you can see different information about each of the coins as well as how the algorithm classified them.



Here is a visualization as to how the data points were classified in three dimensions.



Finally, here is a scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of coins mined and the total supply.



## Summary

We were able to cluster the cryptocurrencies into different categories effectively.  There is further study that is required to figure out what is going to be happening with each of these categories.  We can observe them over time as well as look at historical trends in order to figure out the trends with the pricing over time.
